In full professional retraining in the world of development, I am training at The Hacking Project. This training allows me to learn in peer learning and to be able to learn by creating projects as a team. Thanks to my will, my motivation and the support of my team, I manage to overcome each project with flying colors and it is a real pleasure to continue learning.

Skills: HTML5 CSS3 Ruby
